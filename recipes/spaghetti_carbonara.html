        <li>80g spaghetti</li>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the spaghetti and cook for 8-10 mins or until al dente.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat, add the onion and pancetta and fry for 10 mins until the onion has softened and the pancetta is cooked. Add the garlic to the pan and cook for a further 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg and Parmesan together until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta, reserving 50ml of the cooking water and add both to the pan with the pancetta. Toss well and season with black pepper.
